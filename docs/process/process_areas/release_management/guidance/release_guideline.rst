Software Module Release
-----------------------

1. **Repository Management**:

   * Each software module is contained in its own GitHub repository.
   * Ensure that the repository follows the standard naming conventions and structure.

2. **Release Planning**:

   * Create a release plan for each software module.
   * The release plan should include timelines, milestones, and deliverables.
   * Coordinate with other module owners and platform to align release schedules.

3. **Development and Testing**:

   * According process, feature teams implement and test.
   * Check the :need:`wp__verification__module_ver_report` to ensure that all tests pass before proceeding to the release.
   * In case of failed test, evaluate and possibly justify their failure.

4. **Release Preparation**:

   * Update the version number according to the versioning policy (defined in :need:`doc__platform_release_management_plan`).
   * Prepare release notes documenting the changes, improvements, and bug fixes.
   * Ensure the relevant safety packages are available and complete.
   * Tag the release in the GitHub repository.

5. **Release Execution**:

   * Create a release in the GitHub repository release branch and attach the release notes. For this consider the `GitHub Howto Release <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository/>`_
   * Notify the project lead circle about the release for approval.


Platform Release
----------------

1. **Integration of Software Modules**:

   * The platform release integrates various software modules.
   * Ensure that all software modules are released and tagged before the platform release.

2. **Platform Release Planning**:

   * Create a platform release plan that consumes the timelines from the software module release plans.
   * Define the overall release schedule, including major and minor releases.

3. **Development and Testing**:

   * Integrate the software modules release candidates into the platform.
   * Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure compatibility and stability.
   * Check the :need:`wp__verification__platform_ver_report` to ensure that all tests pass before proceeding to the release.
   * Address any integration issues promptly to initiate bugfixing of the modules.
   * In case of still failed test, evaluate and possibly justify their failure.

4. **Release Preparation**:

   * Check if modules are released.
   * Update the platform version number according to the versioning policy (defined in :need:`doc__platform_release_management_plan`).
   * Prepare platform release notes summarizing the updates from all integrated software modules.
   * Ensure the relevant safety packages are available and complete.
   * Tag the platform release in the GitHub repository.

5. **Release Execution**:

   * Create a release in the GitHub repository release branch and attach the platform release notes. For this consider the `GitHub Howto Release <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository/>`_
   * Notify the project lead circle about the release for approval.
   * Publish within Eclipse SDV.


Tracking and Communication
---------------------------

1. **Tracking**:

   * Use the github project management tools to track the progress of software module releases and the platform release.
   * Maintain a release calendar to visualize the timelines and milestones.

2. **Communication**:

   * Regularly update all stakeholders on the release status as part of the project lead circle.
   * Hold periodic meetings to discuss progress, issues, and dependencies within the tech lead circle.
   * meeting definition and schedule see :ref:`pmp_pm_steering_committees`.


Templates
=========

For the release note a template has been created for module level and for platform level

.. list-table:: Overview
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 37, 37

   * - Project scope
     - Template
   * - Module Release Notes
     - :need:`[[title]] <gd_temp__rel__mod_rel_note>`
   * - Platform Release Notes
     - :need:`[[title]] <gd_temp__rel__plat_rel_note>`

The above templates shall be used
